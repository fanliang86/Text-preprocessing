China is set to launch the #Chang'e-3 #lunar probe on #Monday, the first attempt at a moon landing by any country in over 40 years.

The probe will be launched at around 1:30 am Beijing Time, from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center.

The lunar landing is planned to take place around mid-December. This is the first time that China has attempted a soft landing on any extra-terrestrial surface.

Thus far, only the US and the former Soviet Union have carried out controlled landings on the lunar surface.

The technology to carry out a soft landing, however, has changed quite a bit since then. 

The advancements mean that unlike earlier probes, which were unable to hover or avoid obstacles, the Chang’e-3 will be able to accurately survey landforms and identify the safest place to land.

The probe is #equipped with high-precision, fast-response sensors to analyze its motion and surroundings, while the variable thrust engine, which has been designed and made by Chinese scientists, can generate up to 7500 newtons of thrust.

After entering lunar orbit, Chang’e-3 will go through six stages of deceleration, to descend from a height of 15 kilometers down to the lunar surface.

The mission involves collecting data from the moon’s surface, which will be sent directly back to Earth. A telescope will also be installed on the moon, the first ever in the history of lunar exploration.

Chang’e-3 is carrying both a lander and a moon rover called ""Yutu"" or Jade Rabbit. The rover will survey the #moon’s geological structure and surface substances, while looking for natural resources.

It has the ability to analyze the moon’s crust to depths of up to 100 meters. 

In fact, a total of 80 highly sophisticated scientific equipment will travel to the moon with the Chang’e-3 lander and rover.

As soon as they touchdown, they will start sending back first hand data to Chinese scientists for further analysis.
