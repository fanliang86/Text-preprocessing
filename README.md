R codes for text preprocessing

Quantitative text analysis is increasingly used for descriptive and causal inference in social sciences. However, most textual data are unstructured and complicated. Therefore, it is important to preprocess these texts before any quantitative text analysis. The main goal of text preprocess is to simplify textual data and transform text files to suitable documents for analysis. 

The R codes show the steps for text preprocessing.
